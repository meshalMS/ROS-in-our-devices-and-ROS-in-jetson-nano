The Task Has Two Requests:
(First requests) we need doenload ROS in our devices:

First download (virtualbox6.1.34) simulator by this link:
[virtualbox6.1.34](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

Step to use: Install it>> New >> open new system on this simulator by easily After open new system go to setting >> storage >> files >> click on the system file(Ubuntu 16.04.6 -desktop-i386.iso) that we downloaded from the following link:

{Ubuntu 16.04.7 LTSXenial Xerus} (https://releases.ubuntu.com/xenial/)

Then start Ubuntu on virtualbox simulator and do the normal installation and open Ubuntu on virtualbox.

Then download ROS Kenetic inside Ubuntu by steps in the next link:

[ROS](https://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu)

Then open terminal and paste the following commands in the order:

  sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list' 
  sudo apt install curl # if you haven't already installed curl curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full
  echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc sudo apt install python-rosdep python-rosinstall python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool build-essential
 sudo rosdep init
 rosdep update
(Second requests) we need doenload ROS in jetson nano:
First download version xubuntu 20.04 L4T R32.3.1 from next link: https://github.com/Discombobulated88/Xubuntu-20.04-L4T-32.3.1/releases
By etcher program and with xubuntu 20.04 L4T R32.3.1 system we do (Flash image) process on micro SD card.

And if jetson nano Version A02 we just get in SD card on jetson nano after that a screen will appear installization screen and we complete insatall normally

While if the version B01 we open file on SD card by name (extlinux.conf) and open it by terminal and tybe the next command:

 Sudo vim extlinux.conf 
And add this next line:

 boot/tecira210-p3448-0000-p3449-0000-b00.dtb
after that save the file and we just get in SD card on jetson nano after that a screen will appear initialization screen and we complete insatall normally.

But as for ROS we just paste the commands from Foxy Fitzroy on terminal the commands is in the next link:
